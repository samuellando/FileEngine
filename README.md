## Why do I need this?
This helps remove as mush friction in your file management. Don't wait until your desktop is full to empty it out
but instead spend a minute quickly organizing your workspace.

## How to I get it?
Check out the [releases](https://github.com/SamuelLando/FileEngine/releases) ComandLine interface, then simply run the .jar file.

## Don't like my interface?
File engine is a programmable API, simply import the java package and do as you wish.
